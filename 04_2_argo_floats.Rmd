During the EN728 mission, DFO deployed 2 Argo floats from the RV _Endeavor_ in support of the international [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) [@wong2020]. Both floats were NKE ARVOR core float models, which record temperature, conductivity, and depth. The first float was deployed at station HL_07 after completion of the CTD and ring net operations there. The second float was deployed at station LL_09, also following CTD and ring net operations. The location of each deployment can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:figure2).

Both floats were deployed by hand by two crew using a slip line from the aft starboard deck while the ship was underway doing 1-2 kts. One hour prior to deployment, the floats were pre-tested to confirm establishment of the float's GPS and iridium communications. The floats will remain active for approximately 5 years, collecting vertical profiles from the surface to 2000 m every 10 days. 

The first profile recorded by each float is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure3). This profile was collected during ascent of the float, approximately 2 days after deployment. Salinity sensor data from the floats were compared with bottle salinity measurements collected on the CTD casts (up to a depth of 2000 m) from nearby stations HL07 and LL_09 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure3)), and were found to be consistent.
