# Vertical Profiles of Temperature, Salinity, Dissolved Oxygen {#appA}

This appendix illustrates the vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen for each station sampled during the EN728 mission. Profile plots are organized by hydrographic section (e.g., Halifax Line). These plots were generated routinely throughout the mission and compared against the corresponding bottle salinity and dissolved oxygen measurements obtained via Winkler titrations as a tool to A) evaluate any discrepancies between the dual sensors, B) evaluate which of the dual sensors more closely reflected the corresponding bottle measurements generated at sea, a task which helps guide the final sensor calibration process, and C) evaluate the laboratory measurements for visual outliers. Outliers in the bottle data were identified based on their divergence from replicate samples, when collected, or whether they fell far from the CTD profile data, and were assigned quality control flags according to the quality control flag schema applied to data submitted in DFO's National Repository, BioChem [@Devine_2014]. 

For the majority of the casts conducted during the mission there was excellent congruence between both the primary and secondary dissolved oxygen and conductivity sensors, and between the sensor and bottle data. Although data from the primary and secondary oxygen sensors were comparable, the secondary sensor was closer to the corresponding Winkler titration values than the primary. 

Although bottle chlorophyll measurements are not used to calibrate the sensor data, they were routinely compared against the chlorophyll fluorometer sensor data throughout the mission to evaluate the reliability of the sensor, and to ensure that all bottle sample IDs for parameters measured at sea were accounted for. The discrepancy between the sensor data and bottle measurements was higher, especially at the depth of the chlorophyll maximum, where the sensors underestimated chlorophyll concentration relative to the bottle measurements. Consequently, outliers were assigned to bottle measurements based only on their deviation from replicate bottle values, and not the sensor data.
